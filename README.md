# Send files automatically with FTP (Thought)
 This project is a basic idealization of something I consider necessary for when you want to keep your files or folders updated on a server using the FTP protocol.

How it works: When saving a file or modifying a folder, it automatically sends the change from where the script is being executed to a configured FTP server.

This project uses the ftplib python library:
